        You might know the name, you might know the music, but just who is Hans
        Zimmer? Where did he come from? What's he best known for? Here's
        everything you need to know about the undisputed King of Hollywood film
        music.
      </p>
      <h2>Young Life</h2>
      <p>
        Hans Florian Zimmer was born on September 12, 1957, in Frankfurt,
        Germany. His interest in music began at a very early age. He began
        playing piano at the age of three, but his interest in lessons waned
        after just two weeks. When he was six years old, he decided that he
        wanted to become a composer. "My dad died when I was six," Zimmer told
        CNN Worldbeat. "That's when I decided I was going to become really
        serious about music, because it was my refuge. It was my way of calming
        the demons in me or at the same time sometimes letting them roar,
        letting them rip, letting the monster out and seeing that it wasn't so
        scary being able to look it in the eye." When Zimmer was 14 years old,
        he moved to England. Throughout his childhood, he was expelled from
        several different schools because he preferred to study music instead of
        his schoolwork. When he finally finished school, he began his music
        career by writing jingles for commercials and playing in rock bands. In
        1979, Zimmer, along with Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, put together a
        band called the Buggles. The group recorded the album The Age of
        Plastic, which included the hit song "Video Killed the Radio Star." The
        video for the single became the first ever to be shown on MTV.

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>
        Zimmer spent the early part of his career in the United Kingdom before
        moving to the United States. He is the head of the film music division
        at DreamWorks studios, and works with other composers through the
        company which he founded, Remote Control Productions. His work is
        notable for integrating electronic music sounds with traditional
        orchestral arrangements. Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany
        and moved to London as a teenager. Zimmer began his career playing
        keyboards and synthesisers. A turning point in Zimmer's career occurred
        with the 1988 film Rain Man. Hollywood director Barry Levinson was
        looking for someone to score Rain Man, and his wife heard the soundtrack
        CD of the anti-Apartheid drama A World Apart, for which Zimmer had
        composed the music. Levinson was impressed by Zimmer's work, and hired
        him to score Rain Man. For the 1992 film The Power of One, Zimmer
        travelled to Africa in order to use African choirs and drums in the
        recording of the score. On the strength of this work, Disney Animation
        Studios approached Zimmer to compose the score for the film The Lion
        King. In the 2000s, Zimmer has composed scores for Hollywood blockbuster
        films including Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, The Last Samurai, The Da
        Vinci Code and The Simpsons Movie. Zimmer is also noted for his work on
        the scores of Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, on
        which he collaborated with James Newton Howard.

      <h2>Oscar</h2>
      <p>
        At the 94th Annual Academy Awards ceremony this past March, composer
        Hans Zimmer received his second ever Oscar in the Best Original Score
        category for his work on Dune. The first time he won the award was back
        in 1994 for The Lion King, he’s received twelve Academy Award
        nominations overall, and Zimmer is generally considered to be among the
        greatest film score composers of all time. He’s composed iconic scores
        for films like Gladiator, The Dark Knight, The Last Samurai, The Da
        Vinci Code, Blade Runner 2049, Inception, and so many more.
